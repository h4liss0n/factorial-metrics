Specification #3 (better for senior)

We need a Frontend + Backend application that allows you to post and visualize metrics. 
Each metric will have: Timestamp, name, and value. 

The metrics will be shown in a timeline and must show averages per minute/hour/day 

The metrics will be persisted in the database.
